Hello. Welcome to the Pjuu blog.

Pjuu is a small privacy focused social network written in Python/Flask. This will hopefully soon be changing and that is one of the reasons to start a blog.

The site is developed by me, Joe Doherty (joe on Pjuu). The servers and security are looked after by myself, along with a long time sys admin friend Ant Kenworth (ant on Pjuu).

I am a recovering Linux administrator turned software developer and Ant is still chasing the penguin.

This is a short and sweet welcome message.

We will try to blog as we develop and give an insight into how Pjuu is built and how infrastructure guides this.

Pjuu is free, open-source software and is available on [Github](https://github.com/pjuu).

We look forward to seeing you on [Pjuu](https://pjuu.com/).
